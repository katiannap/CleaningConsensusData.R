# CleaningConsensusData.R

I am a new Data Analyst at the Census Bureau, which collects census data and finds interesting insights from it.

The person who previously had my job left me all the data they had for the most recent census. The data is spread across multiple csv files. They didnâ€™t use R, and they would manually look through these csv files whenever they wanted to find something. Sometimes they would copy and paste certain numbers into Excel for analysis.

The thought of it makes you shiver. This is not scalable or repeatable.

My boss wanted me to dig into the data and find some insights by the end of the day. I had to get all this data into R and perform an analysis. I did this by inspecting, reformatting, updating and removing all the necessary data into their permissible format.
